</body>For this semester, I wish to select and study the Python programming language. According to my study, this language is not overly complex and has a high market value, which is why I chose it. Regarding the format of this Python course, I have watched a lot of videos. I did not think it would be too difficult and can be picked up quickly. The fact that the code is so short is crucial.<p></p>According to my study, Python is still used by several prestigious firms, like IBM, NASA, Netflix, Facebook, Spotify, and others. Learning this language helps me to grab an excellent job in various multinational companies and opens doors for several best positions to settle.In the future, I want to work as a software engineer, which would entail writing documentation for the code, testing it, and troubleshooting it. <p></p>My uncle, who uses Python in his business and comes from a Python background, is the one who first inspired me to learn Python. I used to observe his coding, which is so Cozy, the size of the code was so little, and it contained more multifunction than in other languages. I want to learn this language because I am a guy who cannot recall more than a few lines of code and want it to be short, simple, and understandable.<p></p> I find it fascinating to look up his work because my uncle constantly tries to create different codes and places himself in advantageous situations to accomplish his goals using python. As a result, I became interested in this python coding language, and since my goal is to become a good software engineer with a good salary, I just want to learn the language from scratch to get there.
