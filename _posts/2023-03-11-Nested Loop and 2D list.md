This week i learnt the concepts Nested lop and 2D list from python language.

In Python, a list is a collection of elements that can be of any data type, including other lists. A 2D list, also known as a matrix, is a list of lists, where each element of the outer list is itself a list. This allows us to represent a two-dimensional grid or matrix, where each element has a row and column index.

To access elements of a 2D list, we use two indices: one for the row and one for the column. For example, to access the element in the first row and second column of a 2D list called my_list, we would use my_list[0][1].

Nested loops are commonly used with 2D lists to iterate over all elements of the list. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns.

2D lists are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating two-dimensional data in Python. By using nested loops, we can easily iterate over all elements of the list and perform operations on them. With these tools at our disposal, we can easily work with 2D data in our Python programs.
