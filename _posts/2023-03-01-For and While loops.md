This week I learnt the concepts ['For loop'](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/for%20loop.py) and ['While loop'](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/while%20loop.py) from python. I felt this very exciting and felt the real flavour since the start of this course.

In Python, a for loop is a control flow structure that enables you to execute a block of code for each element while you iterate over a list of them. 

The syntax of a for loop is simple: 

Each element of the sequence is represented by a variable that is defined as the loop iterates over it, and the current variable can be used for any operation. 

When you need to perform an operation on each item in a list or other iterable object, loops come in handy. By learning how to use for loops and different kinds of sequences, you can create Python programs that are more effective and efficient.

A while loop in Python is an effective control flow structure that enables you to continually run a block of code while a specific condition is true. Unlike a for loop, which runs a set number of times depending on an array of iterable objects, a while loop will continue to loop until a particular condition is no longer met.

It's crucial to avoid making loops infinite, even though loops are frequently beneficial. An infinite loop occurs when the condition is always True, and the loop never ends. This can happen if the condition is incorrectly defined or if the code block inside the loop does not change the condition sufficiently for it to eventually become False.

While loops are powerful tools that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. They can be used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times, to repeatedly ask the user for input until a valid input is given, to traverse through a list or other iterable object until a certain condition is met, and much more.

Use of nested loops can make the code hard to read and comprehend very rapidly. Many loop variables and their values can be tricky to keep track of, and mistakes are simple to make.
