This week, I learned about the following [datatypes](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/_posts/python_codes/datatypes.py)
 in Python:

1. `int`: Positive or negative whole numbers, such as -10, 0, or 10.

2. `float`: Decimal numbers, such as -10.0, 0.0, and 10.1.

3. `str`: Character groups called "strings," such as "hello" and "world."

4. `list`: Arranged groups of values, such [1, 2, 3].

5. `tuple`: Ordered, unchanging sequences of values, such as (1, 2, 3).

6. `dict`: Unsorted groups of key-value pairs, such as "name: John," "age: 30."

7. `set`: An unordered collection of singular values, such as 1, 2, or 3.

8. `bool`: A boolean value can be either True or False.

9. `None`: A symbol for the lack of a value.

[Strings](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/_posts/python_codes/stringsExamples.py) are the sequence of characters represented using the single or double quotes.  A string is a sequence of characters that represent some text or data. Strings are surrounded by either single quotes (') or double quotes ("), and the characters within the quotes can be anything from letters, numbers, and symbols to special characters.
1. Concatenation: 
Joins any two or more strings together by using the ‘+’ operator.

2. Slicing: 
You can extract a portion of a string by using slicing. The syntax for slicing is `string[start:end]`, where `start` is the starting index (inclusive) and `end` is the ending index (exclusive).

3. Replacing: 
You can replace a portion of a string with another string using the `replace()` method.

4. Formatting: 
You can insert values into a string using string formatting. There are several methods for string formatting in Python, including the `format()` method, f-strings, and the `%` operator.

5. Length: 
You can get the length of a string using the `len()` function.

6. Case conversion: 
You can convert a string to uppercase or lowercase using the `upper()` and `lower()` methods, respectively.
