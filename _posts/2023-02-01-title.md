<p> <li>Python coding lessons are a lot of fun and a terrific method to advance your programming abilities. This week, I began learning Python programming, and I find it to be quite intriguing.  
The simplicity and clarity of the code are the key reasons I chose Python programming.</li> <li>Since I tend to recall little size codes rather than large ones, I thought the syntax was a little easier to remember.  
I, therefore, began using this programming language this week, installing Python 3.9.12 on my computer at first.</li> <li>I picked up commands like (python  V) to see what version of Python my application is using. 
For understanding this programming language, I referred to YouTube videos by John Mosh, Durga Software Solutions, and Coursera.</li> <li>Additionally, I discovered that because the interpreter takes care of it and the language is dynamic, there is no need to compile any programs or code you write. 
A few language basics, operators, input and output statements, and flow control were taught to me.</li> <li>Since this is the beginning of learning and since these are case-sensitive, I found the Identifiers topic to be intriguing and simple.  
I began running a few little Python scripts using my local terminal. I just entered the idea of data types. And I am super exited to learn further.</li>
