During the past week, I learned about the themes of '[Functions](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/functions.py)' and '[Return Statement](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/Return%20Statement.py)' in the Python programming language.

Defining a function in Python requires the def keyword, the function name, parentheses, and a colon.

The function body is then set below the header with an indent. Functions can be assigned to variables, supplied as arguments to other functions, and returned as values in Python because they are first-class objects.

'Functions' are subsequently an effective tool for coding organization, encouraging code reuse, and improving program readability.

A crucial idea in function programming in Python is the 'Return Statement'. It enables you to end a function while also returning a value to the caller.

A function can be terminated and a value returned to the caller using the return statement. It is a Python keyword that is used in conjunction with an expression or a value that you want to return. 

In addition to returning a value, it can also return a list, a dictionary, or even a function. Depending on the circumstances, it can also be used to exit a function early.
