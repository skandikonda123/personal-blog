This week I learnt the [Exponent Function](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/exponent%20function.py), [2D List and Nested Loop](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/2D%20list%20and%20nested%20loop.py) from the python language. 

The exponent function is a widely used mathematical function that is used to raise a number to a given power. In Python, we can use the exponent function to perform various mathematical operations easily. The exponent function is implemented using the "**" operator in Python. This operator takes two operands, the base and the exponent, and returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.

As we can see, the exponent function in Python is a powerful mathematical tool that can be used to perform various operations easily. Whether we're working with integers, decimals, negative numbers, or variables, the exponent function allows us to easily calculate the power of a given number.

In Python, a list is a collection of elements that can be of any data type, including other lists. A 2D list, also known as a matrix, is a list of lists, where each element of the outer list is itself a list. This allows us to represent a two-dimensional grid or matrix, where each element has a row and column index.

To access elements of a 2D list, we use two indices: one for the row and one for the column. For example, to access the element in the first row and second column of a 2D list called my_list, we would use my_list[0][1].

Nested loops are commonly used with 2D lists to iterate over all elements of the list. The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns

2D lists are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating two-dimensional data in Python. By using nested loops, we can easily iterate over all elements of the list and perform operations on them. With these tools at our disposal, we can easily work with 2D data in our Python programs.

To access elements of a 2D list, we need to use two indices: one for the row and one for the column. This can be tricky to get right, especially if the list is large or complex was one of the major challenge faced by me while learning the concept.
