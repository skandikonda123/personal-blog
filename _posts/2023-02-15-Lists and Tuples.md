This week I learned the topics [Lists](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/_posts/lists.py) and [Tuples](https://github.com/skandikonda123/personal-blog/blob/main/_posts/tuples.py) from python coding. Firstly, to create a list in Python, we use square brackets and separate each item in the list with a comma. 

Consider an example creating  a list called "days_of_week" that contains seven strings, one for each day of the week. 

Notice that the strings are surrounded by quotes (either single or double), which tells Python that they are strings rather than variables.  

Python provides a variety of built-in functions and methods that can be used to manipulate lists.

Here are a few of the most commonly used ones:  Notice that the strings are surrounded by quotes (either single or double), which tells Python that they are strings rather than variables.

len(): Returns the number of elements in a list.

append(): Adds a new element to the end of a list.

insert(): Adds a new element at a specific index in a list.

remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specific element from a list.

sort(): Sorts the elements in a list in ascending order.


A common data structure in the Python programming language is the tuple. Similar to a list, they are used to hold an ordered series of values. 

Tuples, however, contain certain significant distinctions that make them valuable in specific circumstances.  

Tuples and lists differ significantly in a number of ways, one of which is that tuples are immutable. 

This implies that a tuple's contents cannot be modified once it has been constructed. 

They are therefore useful when you want to be sure that the data is continuous.  

tuples are represented using parentheses, with the elements of the tuple separated by commas.

The main challenge faced by me in this learning week of python is that Lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be changed, while tuples are immutable, which means that their contents cannot be changed.

This can be confusing at first, especially if you're used to working with other programming languages.
