I recently completed a mini-project that involved creating a to-do list application using Python and SQLite. During the project, I learned several skills that are essential for working with databases and object-oriented programming in Python.

Skills Learned from the Code
* Working with databases in Python: The code uses the built-in "sqlite3" module to connect to an SQLite database and execute SQL statements. By studying this code, you can learn how to work with databases in Python and how to use SQL statements to manipulate data.
* Object-oriented programming in Python: The code defines a class called “[Todo](https://github.com/SLUSE-Spring2022/miniproject-se_python/blob/main/todos.py)” that encapsulates the functionality of managing todo items. By studying this code, you can learn how to define classes in Python and how to use them to encapsulate functionality.
* CRUD operations in Python: The code defines methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) todo items in the database. By studying this code, you can learn how to implement CRUD operations in Python using SQL statements.
* Error handling in Python: The code does not include any explicit error handling, but working with databases often involves handling exceptions that can occur during database operations. By studying this code, you can learn how to handle errors that can occur when working with databases in Python.
* Testing in Python: Although not explicitly shown in this code, testing is an important aspect of software development, especially when working with databases. By studying this code, you can learn how to write tests to verify the correctness of your database operations in Python.

Additional Skills Learned
* Data manipulation: You need to understand how to manipulate data in Python, including how to pass data to SQL statements using placeholders, how to retrieve data from SQL statements using fetch methods, and how to convert data types between Python and SQL.
* SQL: You need to understand SQL statements, including how to create and modify tables, how to insert, update, and delete data, and how to retrieve data using queries
* SQLite: You need to understand how to connect to an SQLite database, create tables, and execute SQL statements using the built-in sqlite3 module in Python.

Challenges
* Dealing with concurrency issues: If multiple processes or threads access the database simultaneously, concurrency issues can arise, such as data inconsistencies or deadlocks. Careful attention must be paid to the order in which operations are executed and to the use of locks and transactions.
* Security: When working with databases, it's important to consider security issues such as SQL injection attacks and unauthorised access. It's important to follow best practices for securing databases, such as parameterised queries and limiting access to sensitive data.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this mini-project was a fantastic opportunity for me to gain programming skills in Python and database management. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming to create a practical application that solves real-world problems. However, I also realised that working with databases can present some challenges, such as dealing with concurrency issues and security concerns. By studying the code and practicing with these challenges, I can improve my skills and become a more proficient programmer in Python.
